  <code>openIndexKeyCursor(name: String, indexName: String)</code> | Returns object where you can get <code>onSuccess</code> event with iterator to get all <code>objects by index and get access only to the key.
  <code>getIndex(name: String, indexName: String)</code> | Return index by name.

## Basics
* Register Worker 

  Register service worker by it's path, so browser can detect which tasks your worker should do.
  ```javascript
    WorkerTools.registerServiceWorker('/your worker path');
  ```

* Install Worker

  When service worker will be installed it will automatically cache all files which declared in <code>files: Array</code>
  and it's <code>version: String</code>
  > For most projects this method will be enough to set up, but you always can write it as you want
  ```javascript
    importScripts('./js/app-lib.js');

    const version = 'v1';

    const files = [ // files which will be cached
      '/folder_1',
      '/file_1',
      '/folder_2/file_2',
    ];

    WorkerTools.install(files, version);
  ```

* Intercept "fetch"

  When your client sends "fetch" to server it will be intercepted and 
  checked is there access to server or not and gain data from server or from cache.
  > For most projects this method will be enough to set up, but you always can write it as you want
  ```javascript
    WorkerTools.interceptFecth(version);
  ```

* Initialize db: 

  ```javascript
    const db = new Db('YourDataBase', 1);
  ```

* Catch basic events:

  ```javascript
    db.onSuccess = event => {};
    db.onUpgrade = event => {};
    db.onError = event => {}
  ```

* Initialize your first object when db just created:

  When your Database just created you need to initialize objects which you will 
  use in future, you can do it at any time, but at the creation moment it will be the most valuable 
  ```javascript
    db.onUpgrade = event => {
      const indexes = [{ indexName: 'YourIndex', keyPath: 'YourKeyPath', optionalParameters: { unique: false }}];
      const randomNumbers = db.initializeObject('YourObject', { keyPath: 'YourKey'}, indexes);
    };
  ```

* Choose how to track your data
  key Path | Key Generator | Description
  -------- | ------------- | -----------
  No | No |	This object store can hold any kind of value, even primitive values like numbers and strings. You must supply a separate key argument whenever you want to add a new value.
  Yes |	No | This object store can only hold JavaScript objects. The objects must have a property with the same name as the key path.
  No | Yes | This object store can hold any kind of value. The key is generated for you automatically, or you can supply a separate key argument if you want to use a specific key.
  Yes |	Yes |	This object store can only hold JavaScript objects. Usually a key is generated and the value of the generated key is stored in the object in a property with the same name as the key path. However, if such a property already exists, the value of that property is used as key rather than generating a new key.

* Createing indexes: 

  <code>indexName</code> will define which name your index will have. <code>keyPath</code> will define by which property information will be found, <code>optionalParamters</code> defines some additional properties. 
  ```javascript
    const indexes = [
      { indexName: 'key', keyPath: 'key', optionalParameters: { unique: false }},
      { indexName: 'ssn', keyPath: 'ssn', optionalParameters: { unique: true }},
    ];
  ```

* Set | Get | Delete data from your object

  ```javascript
    db.setData('YourObject', { myKeyPath: 'Some unique key', myValue: 'Some value' });
    db.getData('YourObject', 'Some unique key');
    db.deleteData('YourObject', 'Some unique key');
  ```

* Get data from cursor

  You can iterate through cursor and get data from it on each step 
  ```javascript
  db.openCursor('').onSuccess = cursor => {
      if (cursor) {
        const value = cursor.value;
        const key = cursor.key;
        console.log(key, value);
        cursor.continue();
      }
      else {
        console.log('no more entries');
      }
    }
  ```

* Use additional methods to work much easier with your data:

  Useful methods which follow Map conception
  ```javascript
    db.has('YourObject', 'Some unique key');
    db.keys('YourObject');
    db.values('YourObject'); 
    db.clearAll('YourObject')
  ```
