## Basics
* Initialize db: 
```javascript
  const db = new Db('MyDataBase', 1);
```

* Catch basic events:
```javascript
  db.onSuccess = event => {};
  db.onUpgrade = event => {};
  db.onError = event => {}
```

* Initialize your first object when db just created:
```javascript
  db.onUpgrade = event => {
    const indexes = [{ indexName: 'yourIndex', keyPath: 'yourKeyPath', optionalParameters: { unique: false }}];
    const randomNumbers = db.initializeObject('yourObject', { keyPath: 'yourKey'}, indexes);
  };
```

* Choose how to track your data
  key Path | Key Generator | Description
  ------- | ------------- | -----------
  No | No |	This object store can hold any kind of value, even primitive values like numbers and strings. You must supply a separate key argument whenever you want to add a new value.
  Yes |	No | This object store can only hold JavaScript objects. The objects must have a property with the same name as the key path.
  No | Yes | This object store can hold any kind of value. The key is generated for you automatically, or you can supply a separate key argument if you want to use a specific key.
  Yes |	Yes |	This object store can only hold JavaScript objects. Usually a key is generated and the value of the generated key is stored in the object in a property with the same name as the key path. However, if such a property already exists, the value of that property is used as key rather than generating a new key.

* Createing indexes: 
<code>indexName</code> will define which name your index will have. <code>keyPath</code> will define by which property information will be found, <code>optionalParamters</code> defines some additional properties. 
```javascript
  const indexes = [
    { indexName: 'key', keyPath: 'key', optionalParameters: { unique: false }},
    { indexName: 'ssn', keyPath: 'ssn', optionalParameters: { unique: true }},
  ];
```

* Set | Get | Delete data from your object
```javascript
  db.setData('MyObject', { myKeyPath: 'Some unique key', myValue: 'Some value' });
  db.getData('MyObject', 'Some unique key');
  db.deleteData('MyObject', 'Some unique key');
```

* Use additional methods to work much easier with your data:
```javascript
  db.has('MyObject', 'Some unique key');
  db.keys('MyObject');
  db.values('MyObject'); 
  db.clearAll('MyObject')
```
