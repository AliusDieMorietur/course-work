# Library for PWA

## Concept
The current state of PWA is poor. Many problems, many flaws, not convenient syntax, difficulties in launching a project. This library is designed to solve these problems, facilitate the process of creating PWA, reduce duplicate code, etc. Most methods are focused on indexeddb, since there are the most difficulties.

## Tasks
- [x] Basic Tools for worker
- [x] Basic methods for indexeddb
- [x] Set of different methods for working with data inside indexeddb objects
- [x] Support cursor
- [ ] Make additional methods for service workers
- [ ] Make some changes in PWA creation process
- [ ] Write test

## Requirements for PWA
* http-server to serve static
* manifest.json
* icon pack
